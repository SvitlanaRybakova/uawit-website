# UAWIT website

The website for non-profit Organization Ukrainian Women in Tech in Stockholm.

It is build using Next.js + Sanity Studio. The Sanity studio embedded in the project.

## Getting Started

This project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Set up the project locally

Clone the repository and install dependencies `npm install` and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

> **Note**
>
> This starter uses the `/pages` directory for Next.js routing.
>

### Set up the Sanity Studio

This starter is a statically generated site that uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content.
It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more.
You can use this starter to kick-start a clean slate site or learn these technologies.

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and the Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

This will create a git-ignored `.env` file with environment variables that will be used for local development.

Alternatively, you can do the next: create a `.env` file manually and fill it with variables:

```bash
SANITY_API_PROJECT_ID="xxxxxxxx" # You can find this in your sanity account
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID="xxxxxxxx"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="xxxxxxxx"
SANITY_API_DATASET="production" # Here is the name of your dataset, for example, production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET="production"
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/studio/](http://localhost:3000/studio/) with your browser to see the sanity studio.
