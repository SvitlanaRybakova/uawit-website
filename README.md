# UAWIT website

The website for the non-profit Organization Ukrainian Women in Tech in Stockholm.

It is built using Next.js + Sanity Studio. The Sanity studio is embedded in the project.

## Getting Started

This project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

> **Note**
>
> This starter uses the `/pages` directory for Next.js routing.

### Set up the project locally

Clone the repository, install dependencies `npm install` and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev (or yarn dev)
```

Before running a project, please always do `git pull`.

Clone the repository and install dependencies `npm install` and run the development server:

```bash
npm run lint (or npm run lint:fix)
```

Run prettier

```bash
npm run format
```

Run eslint

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can collect a build

```bash
npm run build
```

### How to open a pull-request

To open a new pull-request, you can do next

```bash
clone repo
add origin
open a new branch => git checkout -b
add you changes
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
git add .
git commit
git push
open a pr from github
```

### Set up the Sanity Studio

Before you proceed, please be sure that you have an account on Sanity or create it using that link [Create a sanity project](https://www.sanity.io/docs/create-a-sanity-project)].

This starter is a statically generated site that uses Next.js for the frontend and Sanity to handle its content.
It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more.

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and the Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

This will create a git-ignored `.env` file with environment variables that will be used for local development.

Alternatively, you can do the next: create a `.env` file manually and fill it with variables:

```bash
SANITY_API_PROJECT_ID="xxxxxxxx" # You can find this in your sanity account
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID="xxxxxxxx"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="xxxxxxxx"
SANITY_API_DATASET="production" # Here is the name of your dataset, for example, production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET="production"
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/studio/](http://localhost:3000/studio/) with your browser to see the sanity studio.
(Below is a screenshot for the current data we have on production sanity)

| `/pages/index.tsx`      | Landing page for `/`.                                         |
| `/sanity/schemas.ts`    | Where Sanity Studio gets its content types from               |
| `/sanity/env.ts`        | Configuration for the Sanity project and dataset              |
| `/sanity/schemas.ts`    | Where Sanity Studio gets its content types from               |
| `/sanity/lib/client.ts` | Sanity client configured based on `env.ts`                    |
| `tailwind.config.js`    | Tailwind config. Only applies to files listed under `content` |

All pages are wrapped in `pages/_app.tsx`.

### Sanity Schema

Below are instructions on How to work with different schemas.

To create and see a new type in the sanity studio, you have to do the next steps:

- Before creating a new type, think it if it is needed or data can be static in the template. Create a new type for schema if data is dynamic.
- Think more abstractly when you create a new schema so we can reuse types better in the future.
- Create a new type in the folder `src/schemas/` and import it to `schemaTypes` in file`src/schemas/index.ts`. For example, if you need to create a `Logo type` with fields `logoImage, caption, link`:

```bash
const logo = {
  name: 'logo',
  type: 'document',
  title: 'Logo',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'logoImage',
      type: 'image',
      title: 'Logo Image',
      options: {
        hotspot: true,
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'caption',
      type: 'string',
      title: 'Caption',
      description: 'alt text',
    },
    {
      name: 'href',
      type: 'url',
      title: 'Link',
      description: `Can be a path starting with a ...`,
    },
  ],
}
```

- **Note**: It is always good idea to add description for your schema fields

- Update `sanity.queries` and provide your query

```bash
~/lib/sanity.queries/
  logo/
   queries.ts
   types.ts
  posts/
   queries.ts
   types.ts
  ...
```

- For example if you need to fetch Logo with image, link, alt. The schema will be next

```bash
export const logoQuery = groq`
  *[_type == "logo"] {
    "logoImage": logoImage,
    "caption": caption,
    "href": href,
  }[0] // Logo Query: always fetch first
`
export async function getLogoData(client: SanityClient): Promise<LogoType> {
  return await client.fetch(logoQuery)
}
```

- **Note**: Always fetch the first array, as you can create many logos.

### Deploy on production

Alternatively, you can deploy without a `git` hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm run build
or
npx vercel --prod
```

## Deploy on Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
